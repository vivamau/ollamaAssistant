          <h3>Why Ollama Assistant</h3>
          <p>
            Ollama, along with LM Studio, was one of the first tools that made
            it easy to use AI on our computers. Even though Ollama has recently
            added a graphical interface to make it easier to use, some parts
            still feel a bit lacking. That’s why I’ve created an alternative
            interface with features that I think would be handy for everyday
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ollama Assistant is designed to be a lightweight and user-friendly
            application that enhances your experience with local LLMs. It
            provides a range of features, including prompt management, chat
            history, and customizable settings, all aimed at making your
            interactions with language models more efficient and enjoyable.

          <h3>What is Ollama Assistant?</h3>
          <p>
            <br />
            Ollama Assistant lets you save and organize prompts and link them
            together with your LLMs, makes it a breeze to manage the LLMs
            installed, and lets you create LLM‑boosted setups with documents
            (PDF, txt, Excel, HTML, markdown, etc.) or even with websites'
            content.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a web app built with NodeJS and ReactJS and SQLlite and it
            depends on a Ollama installation. You can turn it into a desktop app
            with Electron, just follow the instructions on the code repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ollama Assistant is open source, published under the AGPL 3

            Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying
            this page, so strong
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary
            too, but the example files are commented well enough that even
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them
            as starting points. Please see the

          <p>
            You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem
            daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but

            guide.

          <h3>Contribute</h3>
          <p>
            Contributing to Ollama Assistant is a great way to improve your
            skills and help others in the community. Whether you&#8217;re a
            seasoned developer or just starting out, there are many ways to get
            involved. You can contribute by reporting bugs, suggesting new
            features, or even submitting code changes through pull requests on
            GitHub.

          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Where possible, we would like to see mostly
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2"
              >CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr
            >
            usage.
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4"
              >CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr
            >
            should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong
            fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
            functional, practical
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest
            bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only
            real requirement we have is that your
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
            implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now.
            When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent
            results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user
            agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in
            mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across
            every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you
            can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome,
            Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the
            population).

            We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright
            laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to
            incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work.
            We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related
            design.
